# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up your first printer and start using Bambuddy.

## Prerequisites

Before adding a printer, ensure:

## Enabling LAN Mode on Your Printer

Bambuddy connects to printers via LAN Mode. Here's how to enable it:

### Step 1: Enable Developer Mode (if required)
Some printer models require Developer Mode to be enabled first:
1. On your printer's touchscreen, go to **Settings**
2. Navigate to **General** or **About**
3. Look for **Developer Mode** and enable it

### Step 2: Enable LAN Mode
1. Go to **Settings** > **Network** > **LAN Mode**
2. Toggle **LAN Mode** to **ON**
3. Note down the **Access Code** displayed (8 characters)

### Step 3: Find Your Printer's Information
You'll need these details:
- **IP Address**: Found in **Settings** > **Network**
- **Serial Number**: Found in **Settings** > **Device Info**
- **Access Code**: Shown when LAN Mode is enabled

> **Tip**: The access code changes every time you toggle LAN Mode off and on.

## Your First Archived Print

Once your printer is connected, Bambuddy automatically archives completed prints:

1. Start a print on your Bambu Lab printer (via Bambu Studio, Handy, or the printer itself)
2. Bambuddy detects the print and monitors progress
3. When the print completes:
   - The 3MF file is downloaded via FTP
   - Metadata is extracted (layers, filament, temperatures, etc.)
   - A thumbnail is generated
   - The print appears in your Archives

### What Gets Archived
- **3MF File**: The complete print file
- **Thumbnail**: Preview image from the slicer
- **Metadata**: Print time, filament usage, layer count, temperatures
- **Finish Photo**: Automatic camera capture (if enabled)
- **Print Result**: Success, failed, or stopped status
